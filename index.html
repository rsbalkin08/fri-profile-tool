The recovering victim does not think that the offender is remorseful, has not experienced meaningful reconciliation, and has not experienced significant change. The injury may have caused significant damage to the relationship, and reconciliation may not be possible. The injury may be unresolved."

    name: "I Might Need To Rethink This",
    desc: "This is a more conflicted profile and might be a person who is trying to reconcile. The injury may have caused significant damage to the relationship, and reconciliation may be unachievable. In this profile, the recovering victim feels there is an overall positive outcome, but feels that the offender is not remorseful, and does not engage in meaningful reconciliation. This could indicate that the recovering victim does not want to reconcile despite feeling that there is a positive outcome. The recovering victim could also be self-protective, and sees leaving or distancing as a positive outcome."
  },
  "HHHL": {
    name: "I'm Not Going To Get Over It",
    desc: "Sometimes, the offender is only truly remorseful and can only reconcile after the damage has been done and the injury is severe. The recovering victim may experience a sense of confusion or ambivalence because the offender’s remorse appears genuine, but it did not prevent harm. The victim may cautiously explore the relationship and consider reconciliation while remaining wary due to the severity of the injury and the delayed change."

    desc: "Simply because reconciliation is beneficial and helpful does not mean it will result in a positive outcome. In this profile, it could indicate that a victim wants to forgive, but perhaps struggles to let go of pain. It could also mean that the victim sees the offender as remorseful, but still thinks the injury was too severe. The victim might engage in reconciliation but still feel the overall outcome is negative. The injury might continue to feel unresolved."

    name: "Not Going To Change And This Is Unhealthy",
    desc: "This profile indicates a potentially unhealthy relationship dynamic. The offender is not remorseful and has not changed, yet the outcome is positive. This could indicate a victim who is minimizing or rationalizing harm, or who is invested in the relationship despite ongoing negative behavior. It may be important to consider whether the victim’s “positive outcome” reflects genuine resolution or coping/avoidance."

    name: "This Is Toxic, But I Like It",
    desc: "Yes, this happens too. This profile indicates that the victim is exploring the injury and sees the outcome as positive, but the offender is not remorseful and does not reconcile or change. This might suggest a relationship where the victim gains clarity or closure through exploration, or where the victim values the relationship despite harm. It may also reflect a complicated dynamic in which positive outcome is defined differently by the victim."

    name: "Not Ending Over This",
    desc: "In a scenario such as this, the recovering victim might feel that the harm doesn’t warrant ending the relationship. The offender is not remorseful and has not changed, but the victim engages in exploration and reconciliation and sees the outcome as positive. This may indicate that the victim is willing to reconcile even without meaningful change, perhaps due to the nature of the relationship or perceived stakes."

    name: "I'm Just Not Into It",
    desc: "Sometimes, feelings change toward a remorseful offender. In this profile, the offender is remorseful and shows change, but reconciliation does not occur and the overall outcome is negative. The victim may no longer desire to repair the relationship, even if the offender is trying. The victim might feel emotionally detached, disinterested, or unable to move forward."
  },
  "HLHH": {
    name: "I'm Kind Of Into It",
    desc: "Occasionally, we become involved in relationships where exploration and change occur later in the process. In this profile, the victim engages in exploration, the offender shows change, reconciliation is present, and the outcome is positive. Even if the early process was weak, later efforts may support repair and a favorable resolution."

    name: "Just No",
